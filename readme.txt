Custom Module To Enable Users To Search Selected Post Types

== Description ==

Sometimes you just want search results to be limited to a custom post type. Or you want to search posts, but not pages. Or you want to search Staff members and projects, but not posts. And now you can!
**Post Type Search Module For Divi** adds a custom module to the Divi Theme by Elegant Themes. This module operates like the standard Search Module, but also allows you to select the Post Types that you want users to be able to search. You can select one post type, or many, the choice is up to you!

This only impacts searches initiated by this custom module, the standard Divi Search Module and WordPress search functions continue to operate normally.
